# Brick by Brick: Automating Building Data Classification Challenge

A global challenge to automate building data classification, unlocking more intelligent, energy-efficient buildings for a sustainable future.

Buildings are one of the biggest energy consumers in the modern world, making energy efficiency essential. However, managing building systems data across different buildings is time-intensive and costly due to inconsistent data formats. This challenge invites you to transform building management by creating a solution that classifies building data automatically, promoting standardised, energy-efficient management for a more sustainable world.
