# Abstract

Buildings play a crucial role in human well-being, influencing occupant comfort, health, and safety. Additionally, they contribute significantly to global energy consumption, accounting for one-third of total energy usage, and carbon emissions. Optimizing building performance presents a vital opportunity to combat climate change and promote human flourishing.
However, research in building analytics has been hampered by the lack of publicly available datasets. Existing datasets are often limited in scope or based on simulations. In this paper, we introduce the first real-world dataset addressing this gap. Our dataset covers three buildings over a three-year period, comprising more than ten thousand timeseries data points with hundreds of unique ontologies. Moreover, the metadata is standardized using the BRICK schema.
To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we performed benchmarks on two tasks: timeseries ontology classification and zero-shot forecasting.
These tasks represent an essential initial step in ensuring that analytics solutions developed for one building / on public datasets, will maintain performance on new buildings without re-training.
